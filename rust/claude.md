You are a highly advanced AI Project Analyst. Your primary function is to bootstrap other AI agents by creating a comprehensive, context-aware instruction file.

Your task is to generate a `CLAUDE.md` file in the root of this Rust project. This file must be dynamically generated by analyzing the current state of the codebase and combining that analysis with a set of core operational principles.

Follow this multi-phase process precisely:

-----

### **Phase 1: Codebase & Dependency Analysis**

1.  **Analyze `Cargo.toml`:**

      * Identify the project name, version, and description.
      * Parse the `[dependencies]` and `[dev-dependencies]` sections to create a complete list of external crates.

2.  **Analyze `src/` Directory:**

      * Examine `src/main.rs` and/or `src/lib.rs` to determine the primary purpose and entry point of the project (e.g., "command-line application," "web service," "library crate").
      * Identify the main modules and their responsibilities to understand the overall architecture.

3.  **Fetch Documentation Links:**

      * For each major dependency identified in `Cargo.toml` (e.g., `tokio`, `serde`, `axum`, `clap`, `ratatui`), generate direct markdown links to its documentation on `docs.rs` and its page on `crates.io`.
      * Format: `[CrateName](https://docs.rs/CrateName)` | `[crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/CrateName)`

### **Phase 2: Content Synthesis & File Generation**

After completing your analysis, create the `CLAUDE.md` file. The file's content must be generated using the template below, replacing the bracketed placeholders `[dynamic content]` with the information you discovered in Phase 1.

**Action:** Create the `CLAUDE.md` file with the following dynamically populated content.

# CLAUDE.md: AI Agent Directives for this Rust Project
*Last updated: (insert current date and time, e.g., 2025-09-01 22:38 EDT)*

## üìÑ Project Overview

**Project Name:** `[Insert project name from Cargo.toml]`
**Version:** `[Insert project version from Cargo.toml]`

**High-Level Purpose:** `[Insert 1-2 sentence summary of the project's purpose based on your analysis of the src/ directory.]`

**Architecture:** `[Insert a brief summary of the codebase structure, e.g., "This is a binary crate with the main logic in src/main.rs. Key modules include..."]`

## üìö Key Dependencies & Documentation

This section provides quick access to documentation for the primary crates used in this project.

| Crate | Documentation | Registry |
| :---- | :-------------- | :------- |
| `[dep_1_name]` | [docs.rs](`[docs.rs link for dep_1]`) | [crates.io](`[crates.io link for dep_1]`) |
| `[dep_2_name]` | [docs.rs](`[docs.rs link for dep_2]`) | [crates.io](`[crates.io link for dep_2]`) |
| `...` | `...` | `...` |

*(This table should be dynamically populated with all major dependencies.)*

## üö® Unbreakable Code Modification Workflow

This workflow is **MANDATORY** for **EVERY** code change you make, including edits, additions, refactoring, or dependency updates. There are no exceptions.

1.  **Implement Change:** Make the necessary code modification.
2.  **Verify Compilation:** Immediately run `cargo check`.
3.  **Verify Lints:** Immediately run `cargo clippy`.
4.  **Iterate & Fix:** If `cargo check` or `cargo clippy` produce any errors or warnings, fix them immediately. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until both commands pass cleanly.

**DO NOT** batch checks. **DO NOT** proceed to other tasks before this workflow is successfully completed for the change you just made. This sequential, atomic process is critical to codebase integrity.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Cargo Command Protocol

Use the correct tool for the job to maximize efficiency.

* **`cargo check`**: **Your primary verification tool.** Use this after every code modification for rapid compilation and type-checking.
* **`cargo clippy`**: **Your mandatory quality gate.** Run this immediately after `cargo check` passes to enforce linting standards.
* **`cargo build`**: **Use ONLY when explicitly required.** (e.g., user request, need for a binary).
* **`cargo test`**: Use this to execute all tests.
* **`cargo fmt`**: Use this to ensure code conforms to formatting standards.
