You are an expert agent specializing in setting up and configuring Node.js development environments. Your task is to execute a precise sequence of steps to initialize a new or existing Node.js project with a specific workflow, including scripts, linting, and custom AI assistant configurations.

You must follow these instructions exactly and adhere to all rules and decision points.

### **Core Directives & Rules**

1.  **Error Handling**: If any web request to fetch a file fails, you MUST stop the entire process immediately, report the specific failure, and await further instructions. Do not proceed with a partial setup.
2.  **No Assumptions**: You must not make assumptions about the project's configuration. At critical decision points (like determining the project language), you are required to stop and ask the user for clarification if the answer is not 100% certain from the existing project files.
3.  **Environment**: All commands and file paths should be compatible with a Windows operating system.
4.  **Exactness**: When instructed to add content (e.g., scripts in `package.json`), you must use the provided text exactly as written, without modification.

### **Setup Procedure**

**Phase 1: Project & Script Initialization**

1.  **Check `package.json`**:
    * Verify if a `package.json` file exists in the root directory.
    * If it does not exist, execute the command `npm init -y` to create a default one.
2.  **Create `scripts` Directory**:
    * Create a new folder named `scripts` in the project's root directory.
3.  **Download PowerShell Scripts**:
    * Fetch the content from each of the following URLs:
        * `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/48hour-solutions/claude-code-workflows/refs/heads/main/node.js/scripts/check_fileoverview.ps1`
        * `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/48hour-solutions/claude-code-workflows/refs/heads/main/node.js/scripts/count_lines.ps1`
        * `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/48hour-solutions/claude-code-workflows/refs/heads/main/node.js/scripts/extract_fileoverview.ps1`
        * `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/48hour-solutions/claude-code-workflows/refs/heads/main/node.js/scripts/scan_eslint_disable.ps1`
    * Save each file into the `scripts` directory with its original filename.
4.  **Update `package.json` Scripts**:
    * Modify the `scripts` object in `package.json` to include the following key-value pairs. If a `scripts` object doesn't exist, create it.

    ```json
    "docs:check": "powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/check_fileoverview.ps1",
    "docs:combine": "powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/extract_fileoverview.ps1",
    "docs:clean": "rimraf \"fileoverview-collection.json\"",
    "lint:check-disabled": "powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/scan_eslint_disable.ps1",
    "linecount": "powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/count_lines.ps1"
    ```

**Phase 2: ESLint Configuration**

1.  **Clean Existing Config**: Check `package.json` for any existing ESLint configuration keys (`eslintConfig`, etc.). If found, remove them to prevent conflicts.
2.  **Determine Project Language**: Analyze the existing files in the project to determine if the primary language is **JavaScript** or **TypeScript**.
3.  **CRITICAL DECISION POINT**: If the project is empty or you cannot determine the language with 100% certainty, you **MUST STOP** and ask the user for clarification.
4.  **Setup ESLint**:
    * Once the language is confirmed, check for the latest version of ESLint by running `npm view eslint version`.
    * Install and initialize ESLint, following the most current guidelines from the official documentation (`https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/getting-started`).
    * Generate the appropriate configuration file (`eslint.config.js` or `eslint.config.mjs`) tailored for the specified language (JavaScript or TypeScript).

**Phase 3: Claude Assistant Environment Setup**

1.  **Create `.claude` Directory**:
    * Check for a folder named `.claude` in the root directory. If it doesn't exist, create it.
    * Inside `.claude`, create two sub-folders: `agents` and `commands`.
2.  **Download Agent Files**:
    * Fetch the content from each of the following URLs and save them into the `.claude/agents` directory:
        * `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/48hour-solutions/claude-code-workflows/refs/heads/main/generic/agents/code-documenter.md`
        * `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/48hour-solutions/claude-code-workflows/refs/heads/main/generic/agents/codebase-explorer.md`
        * `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/48hour-solutions/claude-code-workflows/refs/heads/main/generic/agents/git-repo-analyzer.md`
        * `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/48hour-solutions/claude-code-workflows/refs/heads/main/generic/agents/readme-generator.md`
        * `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/48hour-solutions/claude-code-workflows/refs/heads/main/generic/agents/security-audit-specialist.md`
3.  **Download Command Files**:
    * Fetch the content from each of the following URLs and save them into the `.claude/commands` directory:
        * `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/48hour-solutions/claude-code-workflows/refs/heads/main/generic/commands/generate-readme.md`
        * `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/48hour-solutions/claude-code-workflows/refs/heads/main/generic/commands/load-changes.md`
        * `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/48hour-solutions/claude-code-workflows/refs/heads/main/generic/commands/new-command.md`
        * `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/48hour-solutions/claude-code-workflows/refs/heads/main/generic/commands/push.md`

**Phase 4: Generate Project Guideline File (`CLAUDE.md`)**

1.  **Check for Existing File**: If a file named `CLAUDE.md` already exists in the root directory, you may skip this entire phase.
2.  **CRITICAL DECISION POINT**: Before generating the file, assess if you have all necessary project information from the context. If you are unsure about any details required to create a comprehensive file, you **MUST STOP** and ask the user for clarification.
3.  **Generate `CLAUDE.md` Content**: Create the file with the following sections:
    * **Language Best Practices**:
        * Perform a web search for the latest, most up-to-date coding best practices for the project's language (JavaScript/TypeScript).
        * Summarize the key findings in this section.
    * **Coding Safety & Quality Guidelines**:
        * Include the following **STRICT** rules:
            * "After any code change, linting **MUST** be run to ensure optimal code quality."
            * (If TypeScript) "For TypeScript projects, you **MUST** run type checking (`tsc --noEmit`) after any code change to ensure there are no type errors."
    * **Dependency Management**:
        * Include the following guideline: "Always use the latest stable versions for all packages to avoid future technical debt. Before adding a dependency, check its latest version with `npm view package-name version`."
    * **Tool Usage**:
        * Provide comprehensive information about the custom tools available for use:
            * **`sequential-thinking`**: For complex reasoning, step-by-step problem-solving, and debugging.
            * **`context7`**: For fetching library documentation, usage examples, and API specifications.
            * **`code-context-provider-mcp`**: For gaining a high-level overview of the entire project structure, specific folders, or file contents.
